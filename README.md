The idea for this software was partly inspired by my Tech exam in 2003. That SANDARC-VEC session was on text-mode computer terminals connected to a dot matrix printer for the results.

Since then, SANDARC eliminated its fee, but also went back to all-paper exams. With the reticence of SANDARC and all VECs /except/ GLAARG, ARRL, W5YI and Anchorage to offer fully-remote exams (not even on ExamTools), it seemed time to gather FOSS elements into end-to-end Volunteer Examination software that runs without centralized servers, while still maintaining the utmost degree of integrity and auditability between peered VEs, examinee, and VEC.
